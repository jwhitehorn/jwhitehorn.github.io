It's been a busy past couple of days, so I haven't gotten to post the way I wanted to. Neither have I gotten to continue my [hacking with Bluetooth LE](http://jason.whitehorn.ws/posts/hacking-bluetooth/) nor my [learning of calatrava](http://jason.whitehorn.ws/posts/learning-calatrava/).

But, when a [good friend](https://github.com/derekbjohnson) shared a link to [The Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io), I just had to share.

[My report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/jwhitehorn) was a fun read, certainly inflated my ego with phrases like "epic Rubyist" and "fulltime hacker". Though, the former [adjective is random](https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/3696e53afdcdb4b196030b7283c1d106ee664fec/osrc/templates/user.html#L17) :-) 

That is all for today, have a good weekend!
